Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an important and effective encryption method for enhancing data security in cloud environments, and this project emphasizes its importance. The effectiveness of ECC in offering quick encryption and decryption while minimizing computation costs is demonstrated through a thorough comparison with the traditional AES algorithm. This project highlights how ECC can help to reduce security worries related to cloud storage, making it a valuable tool to add to the toolbox of data protection techniques and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data in cloud-based applications.
